# My name is Matthew Tralka, and I am a software engineer.

## Currently, I am operating at the intersection between *software engineering* and *geospatial information science* at <a href="https://geog.umd.edu/" target="_blank">UMD</a>.

My passion is in accelerating data equity and enriching humanity by spearheading novel computing initiatives. In this pursuit, I have worked as a software engineer or researcher on projects for USGS, NASA, IARPA, and the NGA.

In my free time, I've sailed over [*19,000 nautical miles*](/sailing), earned my PADI Rescue Diver certificate, and am slowly - but happily - checking off books from my "must read" list.
